# Database for Microclimate Mesonet Research
This repo holds files that are needed to create, fill, and test the database for the microclimate mesonet project

# Whats a Mesonet
A network of weather sensing devices that can record the weather information around them. This collecting of data can be used to track weather movements on a accurate scale. Tracking the sudden creation and change in tornados and other weather forces are now possible with a mesonet.

# What is this project
The purpose of this project is to present an overview of the construction efforts, instruments, real-time network,
and database used on the tower as well as the collaborations that allowed the development of a website. The website would be a statistical summary of the validation efforts and
highlights of interesting weather events.

in short, we wanted to create instructions so others could create there own mesonet and an accompanying website to view the weather data being recorded.
